    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Transactalyze was created with a single purpose — to make understanding your financial transactions fast, easy, and private. We believe that you shouldn't have to link your bank account or download clunky apps just to make sense of your own money.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Whether you're a freelancer, small business owner, or a budget-conscious individual, our tool helps you upload bank statements, extract transactions, and categorize them using the power of AI — all within seconds. No logins, no data tracking, no nonsense.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Every design choice we've made puts privacy first. Transactalyze doesn't store any of your uploaded files. All processing happens temporarily, and no personal data is shared.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      As we grow, we aim to add more features like smarter insights, seamless export to the tools you already use and various other financial products — while keeping our commitment to simplicity and security.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-10">Built with ❤️ by a small team obsessed with finance and automation.</p>
